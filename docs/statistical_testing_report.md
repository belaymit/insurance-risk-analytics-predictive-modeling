## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of comprehensive statistical hypothesis testing conducted to validate or reject key hypotheses about risk drivers in our insurance portfolio. The analysis was designed to form the basis of a new segmentation strategy by systematically testing risk differences across various demographic and geographic dimensions.

**Key Objectives:**
- Statistically validate risk differences across provinces, zip codes, and gender
- Quantify margin (profitability) differences across geographic segments
- Provide evidence-based recommendations for pricing and segmentation strategy
- Support regulatory filings with actuarially sound statistical evidence

**Methodology:**
- A/B Testing framework with appropriate statistical tests
- Significance level: α = 0.05
- Effect size calculations for practical significance assessment
- Business impact quantification for each hypothesis

## Hypotheses Tested

### 1. Provincial Risk Hypothesis
**H₀**: There are no risk differences across provinces  
**H₁**: There are significant risk differences across provinces

**Business Context**: Provincial differences could justify regional pricing adjustments and territory management strategies.

### 2. Zip Code Risk Hypothesis
**H₀**: There are no risk differences between zip codes  
**H₁**: There are significant risk differences between zip codes

**Business Context**: Granular geographic risk assessment for micro-targeting and localized pricing strategies.

### 3. Zip Code Margin Hypothesis
**H₀**: There are no significant margin (profit) differences between zip codes  
**H₁**: There are significant margin differences between zip codes

**Business Context**: Profitability optimization through territory-specific strategies and resource allocation.

### 4. Gender Risk Hypothesis
**H₀**: There are no significant risk differences between Women and Men  
**H₁**: There are significant risk differences between Women and Men

**Business Context**: Actuarial assessment of gender as a rating factor (subject to regulatory constraints).

## Methodology & Statistical Framework

### Metrics Selection

**Primary Risk Metrics:**
1. **Claim Frequency**: Binary indicator (0/1) for policies with at least one claim
   - Measures: Probability of risk occurrence
   - Statistical Test: Chi-square test of independence
   - Business Impact: Directly affects loss ratios and pricing adequacy

2. **Claim Severity**: Average claim amount when claims occur (conditional on claims > 0)
   - Measures: Cost magnitude when risk materializes
   - Statistical Test: ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis (multiple groups), t-test/Mann-Whitney U (two groups)
   - Business Impact: Influences reserve requirements and reinsurance needs

3. **Margin**: Profit per policy (TotalPremium - TotalClaims)
   - Measures: Profitability by segment
   - Statistical Test: ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis (multiple groups), t-test/Mann-Whitney U (two groups)
   - Business Impact: Direct measure of business performance

### Statistical Testing Strategy

**Test Selection Framework:**
- **Normality Assessment**: Shapiro-Wilk and D'Agostino tests for distribution identification
- **Categorical Outcomes**: Chi-square test of independence with Cramér's V effect size
- **Continuous Outcomes (Parametric)**: t-test/ANOVA with Cohen's d/eta-squared effect sizes
- **Continuous Outcomes (Non-parametric)**: Mann-Whitney U/Kruskal-Wallis with rank-based effect sizes
- **Variance Homogeneity**: Levene's test for equal variances assumption

**A/B Testing Design:**
- **Control Group (A)**: Lower-risk or baseline segment
- **Test Group (B)**: Higher-risk or comparison segment
- **Sample Size**: Minimum 30 observations per group for reliable inference
- **Power Analysis**: Post-hoc power calculation for detected effects

### Data Segmentation Strategy

**Geographic Segmentation:**
- Top 5 provinces by policy volume for provincial analysis
- Top 10 zip codes by policy volume for zip code analysis
- Median-split approach for high vs. low risk/margin groups

**Demographic Segmentation:**
- Clean gender categories: Male vs. Female
- Exclusion of missing or ambiguous gender classifications

## Statistical Results Framework

### Interpretation Criteria

**Statistical Significance:**
- **p < 0.01**: Highly significant (strong evidence against H₀)
- **0.01 ≤ p < 0.05**: Significant (moderate evidence against H₀)  
- **p ≥ 0.05**: Not significant (insufficient evidence against H₀)

**Effect Size Interpretation:**
- **Cramér's V**: 0.1 (small), 0.3 (medium), 0.5 (large)
- **Cohen's d**: 0.2 (small), 0.5 (medium), 0.8 (large)
- **Eta-squared**: 0.01 (small), 0.06 (medium), 0.14 (large)

**Business Significance Thresholds:**
- Risk differences ≥ 10% considered practically significant
- Margin differences ≥ R500 considered material
- Loss ratio differences ≥ 5 percentage points considered actionable

## Expected Business Impact Analysis

### Risk-Based Pricing Implications

**If Provincial Differences Are Significant:**
- Implement provincial rating factors (5-20% adjustments)
- Develop region-specific underwriting guidelines
- Adjust marketing spend allocation by province
- Consider provincial reinsurance arrangements

**If Zip Code Differences Are Significant:**
- Create granular territorial rating (2-15% adjustments)
- Implement micro-geographic risk scoring
- Develop location-based product offerings
- Optimize agent/broker network by territory risk

**If Gender Differences Are Significant:**
- Consider gender as an actuarial rating factor (regulatory permitting)
- Develop gender-specific marketing strategies
- Adjust product design for risk profile differences
- Enhance claims management by demographic segment

### Profitability Optimization Strategy

**High-Margin Territories:**
- Increase market penetration efforts
- Implement retention programs
- Consider premium rate optimization
- Expand product offerings

**Low-Margin Territories:**
- Implement corrective pricing actions
- Review underwriting standards
- Consider market exit strategies
- Negotiate reinsurance arrangements

## Regulatory Considerations

### Compliance Framework

**Rating Factor Validation:**
- Statistical significance required for rate filing
- Actuarial memorandum documenting methodology
- Credibility standards for risk classification
- Anti-discrimination compliance verification

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Detailed statistical analysis supporting rate changes
- Effect size quantification for materiality assessment
- Business justification for risk factor implementation
- Monitoring plan for ongoing validation

### Ethical Considerations

**Social Equity Assessment:**
- Geographic redlining prevention measures
- Affordability impact analysis
- Community access maintenance

## Risk Management Considerations

### Statistical Risks
- **Type I Error**: False rejection of true null hypothesis (false positive)
- **Type II Error**: False acceptance of false null hypothesis (false negative)
- **Multiple Testing**: Increased familywise error rate
- **Sample Size**: Insufficient power for small effect detection

### Business Risks
- **Competitive Response**: Market share impact of pricing changes
- **Customer Attrition**: Retention risk from rate increases
- **Regulatory Challenge**: Approval delays or rejections
- **Implementation Complexity**: System and process change risks

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Conservative Significance Levels**: Use α = 0.01 for critical decisions
- **Effect Size Focus**: Emphasize practical over statistical significance
- **Gradual Implementation**: Phase in changes over multiple periods
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking and adjustment
